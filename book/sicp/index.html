            The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly
            these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all
            complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or
            complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at
            once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3.
            The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real
            existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

        We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings
        that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The
        evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct
        processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
    </p>
    <p>
        A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is
        not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer
        questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory.
        The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from
        symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our
        processes to perform.

    <h2>
        1.1 The Elements of Programming
    </h2>
    <p>
        A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks.
        The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when
        we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for
        combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for
        accomplishing this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>primitive expressions</b>, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,</li>
            <li><b>means of combination</b>, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and</li>
            <li><b>means of abstraction</b>, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. (Later we will discover that
        they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is ``stuff'' that we want to manipulate, and procedures are
        descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be
        able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and
        abstracting procedures and data.
    </p>
    <h3>1.1.1 Expressions</h3>
    <p>
        One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical interactions with an interpreter for
        the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Imagine that you are sitting at a computer terminal. You type an expression,
        and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its evaluating that expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number. (More precisely, the expression that you
        type consists of the numerals that represent the number in base 10.) If you present Lisp with a number
    </p>
    <p>
        486
    </p>
    <p>
        the interpreter will respond by printing<sup><a name="quote5"><a href="#ref5">5</a></a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>486</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Expressions representing numbers may be combined with an expression representing a primitive
        procedure (such as + or *) to form a compound expression that represents the application of the procedureto those numbers. For example:
    </p>
    <table class="codz"><tr><td>
    <pre>
        (+ 137 349)
        <i>486</i>
        (- 1000 334)
        <i>666</i>
    </pre> 
    </td></tr></table>
    
    <p>
        Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote
        procedure application, are called combinations. The leftmost element in the list is called the operator, and
        the other elements are called operands. The value of a combination is obtained by applying the procedure
        specified by the operator to the arguments that are the values of the operands.
    </p>
    <p>
        which the interpreter would readily evaluate to be 57. We can help ourselves by writing such an
        expression in the form following a formatting convention known as pretty-printing, in which each long combination is written so
        that the operands are aligned vertically. The resulting indentations display clearly the structure of the
        expression. 
    </p>
    <table class="codz">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <pre>
        (+ (* 3
              (+ (* 2 4)
                 (+ 3 5)))
           (+ (- 10 7)
        6))</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
        Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in the same basic cycle: It reads an
        expression from the terminal, evaluates the expression, and prints the result. This mode of operation is
        often expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a read-eval-print loop. Observe in particular that it is
        not necessary to explicitly instruct the interpreter to print the value of the expression.<sup><u>7</u></sup>
    </p>
    <h3>1.1.2 Naming and the Environment</h3>
    <p>
        A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using names to refer to
        computational objects. We say that the name identifies a <i>variable</i> whose <i>value</i> is the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with <font face="Courier">define</font>. Typing
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Courier">
        (define size 2)
    </p>
    <p>
        One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking procedurally. As a case in point, let us
        consider that, in evaluating combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                To evaluate a combination, do the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.</li>
                    <li>
                        Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to
                        the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in general. First, observe that the
        first step dictates that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first
        perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus, the evaluation rule is recursive
        in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.

        <b>Figure 1.1: </b>Tree representation, showing the value of each subcombination.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called special forms. Define is the only example of aspecial 
        form that we have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly. <span style="background-color:#88BB77;">Each 
        special form has its own evaluation rule.</span> The various kinds of expressions (each with its associated evaluation
        rule) constitute the syntax of the programming language. In comparison with most other programming languages, Lisp has a
        very simple syntax; that is, the evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple general rule
        together with specialized rules for a small number of special forms.

        A formula is 
        $h_{\theta(x)}=\theta_{0}+\theta_{1}x_{1}+\theta_{2}x_{2}$
        \[\large p(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}e^{-x^2}\]
        $|r| = 
        \begin{cases}
        \begin{align*}
            r,\quad & \text{if $r$ > 0} \\ 
            0,\quad & \text{if $r$ = 0} \\
            -r,\quad & \text{if $r$ < 0}
        \end{align*}
        \end{cases}$
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use block structure extensively to help us break up large programs into tractable pieces. 28 The
        idea of block structure originated with the programming language Algol 60. It appears in most advanced
        programming languages and is an important tool for helping to organize the construction of large
        programs.

    <h2>
        1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used primitive arithmetic operations, we
        have combined these operations, and we have abstracted these composite operations by defining them as
        compound procedures. But that is not enough to enable us to say that we know how to program. Our
        situation is analogous to that of someone who has learned the rules for how the pieces move in chess but
        knows nothing of typical openings, tactics, or strategy. Like the novice chess player, we don't yet know the
        common patterns of usage in the domain. We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making
        (which procedures are worth defining). We lack the experience to predict the consequences of making a
        move (executing a procedure).

            Lisp systems typically provide features to aid the user in formatting expressions. Two especially useful features are one that automatically
            indents to the proper pretty-print position whenever a new line is started and one that highlights the matching left parenthesis whenever a right
            parenthesis is typed.

        We concentrated in chapter 1 on computational processes and on the role of procedures in program design.
        We saw how to use primitive data (numbers) and primitive operations (arithmetic operations), how to
        combine procedures to form compound procedures through composition, conditionals, and the use of
        parameters, and how to abstract procedures by using define. We saw that a procedure can be regarded
        as a pattern for the local evolution of a process, and we classified, reasoned about, and performed simple
        algorithmic analyses of some common patterns for processes as embodied in procedures. We also saw that
        higher-order procedures enhance the power of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to
        reason in terms of, general methods of computation. This is much of the essence of programming.
    </p>
    <h2>
        2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction
    </h2>
    <p>
        In section 1.1.8, we noted that a procedure used as an element in creating a more complex procedure could
        be regarded not only as a collection of particular operations but also as a procedural abstraction. That is,
        the details of how the procedure was implemented could be suppressed, and the particular procedure itself
        could be replaced by any other procedure with the same overall behavior. In other words, we could make
        an abstraction that would separate the way the procedure would be used from the details of how the
        procedure would be implemented in terms of more primitive procedures. The analogous notion for
        compound data is called data abstraction. Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how
        a compound data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that are to use compound data objects so that
        they operate on ``abstract data.'' That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make no
        assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand. At the same time,
        a ``concrete'' data representation is defined independent of the programs that use the data. The interface
        between these two parts of our system will be a set of procedures, called selectors and constructors, that
        implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete representation. To illustrate this technique, we will
        consider how to design a set of procedures for manipulating rational numbers.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2.1.1 Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers
    </h3>
    <p>
        Suppose we want to do arithmetic with rational numbers. We want to be able to add, subtract, multiply,
        and divide them and to test whether two rational numbers are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us begin by assuming that we already have a way of constructing a rational number from a numerator
        and a denominator. We also assume that, given a rational number, we have a way of extracting (or
        selecting) its numerator and its denominator. Let us further assume that the constructor and selectors are
        available as procedures:
